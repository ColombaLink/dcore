# 0.1.1 

- [x] Add new resources to a document
- [ ] Multi-device support 
   - Peer discovery is out of scope. We assume that GitLab or GitHub is used to share the document.
   - The default flow will look like this:
      - Create a new identity
      - Create a new document
      - Add the identity to the document
      - Add resources to the document
      - Share the document on GitHub or GitLab
      - Clone the document to another device 
      - On the other device, add the identity+device to the document 
      - From now on, they can also sync locally
