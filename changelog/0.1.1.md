# 0.1.1 

- [x] F1: Add new resources to a document
- [x] F2: Multi-device support 
   - Peer discovery is out of scope. We assume that GitLab or GitHub is used to share the document.
   - The default flow will look like this:
      - Create a new identity
      - Create a new document
      - Add the identity to the document
      - Add resources to the document
      - Share the document on GitHub or GitLab
      - Clone the document to another device 
      - On the other device, add the identity+device to the document 
      - From now on, they can also sync locally 
   - [x] F2.1: Test the proposed workflow
   - [x] F2.2: Allow to set the local device name 
- [ ] Fix1: Remove hardcoded user document_utils.rs::43 
- [x] Fix2: nondeterministic behavior when setting key value pairs on a resource [see](./0.1.1/feature/2211/test-set-key-value.md)

# Worklog

## F2: Multi-device support

Which parts are involved? 

- Identity, device -> name

Where do we store the device names? 

- Implicit in the event log name 

i.e.: 

/{resource-name}/{id-fingerprint}/{device-name}/

What needs to be changed? 

- [x] add device info when creating new resource 
- [x] loading resource
  - it was not necessary to change anything here, 
    because we match all the logs by the resource name.
